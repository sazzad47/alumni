This website is optimized for SEO and offers dynamic features for managing a school alumni association. Developed using Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and other technologies, it requires payment registration for members to participate in any events posted by the admin. The website offers email verification with OTP code for secure authentication and password recovery options for users.

The website also offers two different themes for user preference. Admins have complete control over the website's contents, including the ability to upload, update, or delete them. They can also approve pending member requests and grant access to the website upon approval. Furthermore, admins can send email notifications about any content that they post on the website.
